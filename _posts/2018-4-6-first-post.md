<p>Here lies my goals and hopeful outcome for my game. I will outline what I wish to accomplish, the purpose of my game itself, and potentially include conecpt art that I will update occasionally.</p>

<hr />

<h1>Henceforth I begin my gaming journey.</h1>


<h2>Part 1: The Goals</h2>

<p>These are the skills I wish to learn by creating a game.</p>

<ul>
<li>3D Modeling</li>
<ul><li>Using the Blender modeling program</li></ul>
<li>Game Programming</li>
<ul><li>Using the Unity Engine</li>
<li>Coding with C++</li>
<li>Working with lighting/camera functions</li></ul>
<li>Learn to develop stories/characters thoroughly</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2>Part 2: The Game</h2>

<p>This is a loose breakdown of the game's objective and atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Characters:</h3>
<h4>Main Character</h4>
<p>The main chracter will be a cute, cartoonish, bipedal cat by the name of <b>[REDACTED]</b> of whom the player can change the color of.</p>
<p>If I so feel compelled, I may include other player-customizable features, such as the addition of clothing, fur patterns, or facial features.</p>

<h4>Helper_Bot</h4>
<p>A non-playable chracter (of the same species as the main) who will stand somewhere in the search-area and will give out search hints when interacted with. The number of hints will be three, and will be randomized based on the findable objects in the round.</p>

<h3>Setting:</h3>
<p>A dystopian Cyberpunk city with a gloomy atmosphere, much like <i>Blade Runner</i> or <i>Observer</i> (see <a href="#cart">Concept Art</a>).</p>
<p>Again, if I'm feeling compelled to, I may include "bonus settings" that would allow a player to alter the colors of the environment, or something of the like.</p>
<p>Although the wider world may appear larger, gameplay will onlky take place within a tiny alloted area, as to both make gameplay easier as well as reduce the amount of modeling I need to do.</p>

<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
<p>The player will need to search for a certain number of specified items in the alloted area within a given time limit.</p>
<p>With each "level" that the player completes, the time limit will become shorter, and the items will become more difficult to find. Will I randomize the hiding places? If I can figure out how to, then maybe.</p>

<h2><a id="cart">Concept Art</a></h2> 

<p>These are my "inspirations" for characters, atmosphere, and gameplay (will be updated as I develop everything further).</p>
