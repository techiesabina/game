<p>This is an idea that I conceived about a game meant to discuss climate change.</p>



<h1>Climate-Change: The Reality</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Part 1: The Game's Outline</h2>

<p>This game will be a subtle commentary on the effects of climate change. I'm not sure of a plot yet, but I know that as you progress the character through the polluted world, the condition of the environment will gradually begin to improve as the player completes each new task and follows through the plot.</p>

<p>At intermittent points, there will be subtle hints/drops about the improving state of the world. For example, after the player completes <i>X</i> number of tasks, he/she will pass by a radio or TV where he hears, "Congress has just voted for a tax on carbon!" or "Beef sales have been steadily decreasing as consumers veto animal products." These suggestive tidbits will resonate with the player, and by the end of the game, he/she will be more aware of the issue we're currently facing as a society.</p>

<hr />
<h2>Part 2: The Game</h2>

<p>This is a loose breakdown of the game's objective and atmosphere.</p>

<h3><b>Characters:</b></h3>
<h4>Main Character</h4>
<p>Probably a humanoid of sorts. I can't imagine the figure being detailed, but rather just a vague silhouette of a stick-person.</p>

<h3><b>Setting:</b></h3>
<p>Probably a sick perversion of the world we have now. Everything will have become very polluted and industrial, meaning that most of the developed world will look like modern-day New Dehli, or Congo. (see <a href="#cart">Concept Art</a>).</p>

<h3><b>Gameplay:</b></h3>
<p>Work in progress.</p>


<hr />
<h2><a id="cart">Concept Art</a></h2> 

<p>No concept art yet. This is still an infantile idea.</p>
