<p>This is an idea that I conceived about a game meant to discuss climate change.</p>



<h1>Climate-Change: The Reality</h1>
<hr />

<h2>Part 1: The Game's Outline</h2>

<p>This game will be a subtle commentary on the effects of climate change. I'm not sure of a plot yet, but I know that as you progress the character through the polluted world, the condition of the environment will gradually begin to improve as the player completes each new task and follows through the plot.</p>

<p>At intermittent points, there will be subtle hints/drops about the improving state of the world. For example, after the player completes <i>X</i> number of tasks, he/she will pass by a radio or TV where he hears things like,</p>

<p>"Beef sales have been steadily decreasing as consumers veto animal products."</p> 
<p>"Congress has just voted for a tax on carbon!"</p>

<p>These suggestive tidbits will resonate with the player, and by the end of the game, he/she will be more aware of the issue we're currently facing as a society.</p>
<p>Additionally, the player may begin to notice smog clearing, the coastal water becoming clearer, or more animals about. By the end of the game, these gradual changes will have altered the entire state of the city (implying the world has changed, as well) and having restored it to a beautiful, green state.</p>

<h2>Part 2: The Game</h2>

<p>This is a loose breakdown of the game's objective and atmosphere.</p>

<h3><b>Characters:</b></h3>
<h4>Main Character</h4>
<p>Probably a humanoid of sorts. I can't imagine the figure being detailed, but rather just a vague silhouette of a stick-person.</p>

<h3><b>Setting:</b></h3>
<p>Probably a sick perversion of the world we have now. Everything will have become very polluted and industrial, meaning that most of the developed world will look like modern-day New Dehli, or Congo. A large portion of NPCs will be wearing very covered, conservative clothing and face masks (like in Beijing). There will be very few animals around, such as birds or stray pets, and all vegetation will be withered. The animals that are shown will be ugly and deteriorated as a result of littering and such. There will be lots of litter about.</p>

<p>The specific location of the game will be on a coastal city, however, with a bustling port and impressive skyline, like Boston. (See <a href="#cart">Concept Art</a>).</p>

<h3><b>Gameplay:</b></h3>
<p>The player will have to complete a series of decision-making tasks that, unbeknownst to them, are actually positively affecting the environment and their health.</p>

<p>For example, the player will have to go have a checkup, where the doctor tells them about their high cholesteral as a result of meat consumption, leading to the player to not only becoming more wary about their diet, but also about how badly the meat industry damages the ecosystem.</p>

<p>In another instance, the player will need to go grocery shopping. However, they have very little money, and is not able to buy meats or cheese, just fresh produce, that begins them on a path of healthier, sustainable living.</p>

<p>Following this, the player will have to visit someone's house, and they get the choice of walking or taking a "green bus" as opposed to a vehicle. On the way, there will be pop-ups of facts and statistics pertaining to the high levels of pollution from fossil-fuel based transportation.</p>

<h3><b>Details/Ideas:</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>The start screen will be a fly-over of the poulluted city and some detailed shots of various parts of the city. Then, we will zoom in to a single green sprout blooming from a park or something, inspiring hope for what could be.</li>
<li>For the first part of the game, there will be lots of vehicles, and you will see them all emitting noxious smoke and pollution.</li>
<li>The soundtrack for the beggining opf the game will be slow, dreary instrumental music (Think of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DLnhdnSUVs" target="_blank">"Elegy to the Arctic"</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1mFwDceMI8" target="_blank">"Sad Cello Music"</a> ). In the end, it will be cheery instumental music instead (Think of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hej-McdoYYw" target="_blank">"The Prime Minister's Love Theme"</a>) or the latter part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9gFLkNdHvA" target="_blank">"Arrival of The Birds"</a>.</li>
<li>If the game gets rather advanced, I may have two paths the player can take to alter the state of the world. In this instance, the "base world" will become that of an averagely-polluted American city, like Houston or Boston. The player will then be able to make decision in-game to improve the state of the environment or completely destroy it. Regardless of the path one chooses, each route will be very educational about green practices.</li>
<li>The credits screen will undoubtedely be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pt1N5CsMf8c" target="_blank">"Kisses and Cake"</a>.</li>
 </ul>

<h2><a id="cart">Concept Art</a></h2> 

<p>I'd like to thinlk that the visual style will be somewhat similar to the flat, simple style of @tamagotchi44's game, which you can see concept art of on his <a href="https://twitter.com/tamagotchi44" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>I also take stylistic inspiration from games like <a href="http://thatgamecompany.com/journey/" target="_blank">Journey</a>.</p>
